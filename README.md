## 自说Me话 ##
New Blog of <http://ISayme.com> based on GitHub Pages.

If you are seeing the old posts, only having to add '.html' to the post link you want to view. All works well.

**If you want to fork me, please delete the directories `demo`, `uploads` and all posts in `_posts`, thx~**

Have questions or want to contact me, feel free to mail i[AT]isayme.com. :-)
